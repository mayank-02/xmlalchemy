            <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
            <LINE>What, Lucius, ho!</LINE>
            <LINE>I cannot, by the progress of the stars,</LINE>
            <LINE>Give guess how near to day. Lucius, I say!</LINE>
            <LINE>I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.</LINE>
            <LINE>When, Lucius, when? awake, I say! what, Lucius!</LINE>
        </SPEECH>
        <STAGEDIR>Enter LUCIUS</STAGEDIR>
        <SPEECH>
            <SPEAKER>LUCIUS</SPEAKER>
            <LINE>Call'd you, my lord?</LINE>
        </SPEECH>
        <SPEECH>
            <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
            <LINE>Get me a taper in my study, Lucius:</LINE>
            <LINE>When it is lighted, come and call me here.</LINE>
        </SPEECH>
        <SPEECH>
            <SPEAKER>LUCIUS</SPEAKER>
            <LINE>I will, my lord.</LINE>
        </SPEECH>
        <STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>
        <SPEECH>
            <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
            <LINE>It must be by his death: and for my part,</LINE>
            <LINE>I know no personal cause to spurn at him,</LINE>
            <LINE>But for the general. He would be crown'd:</LINE>
            <LINE>How that might change his nature, there's the question.</LINE>
            <LINE>It is the bright day that brings forth the adder;</LINE>
            <LINE>And that craves wary walking. Crown him?--that;--</LINE>
            <LINE>And then, I grant, we put a sting in him,</LINE>
            <LINE>That at his will he may do danger with.</LINE>
            <LINE>The abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins</LINE>
            <LINE>Remorse from power: and, to speak truth of Caesar,</LINE>
            <LINE>I have not known when his affections sway'd</LINE>
            <LINE>More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof,</LINE>
            <LINE>That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,</LINE>
            <LINE>Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;</LINE>
            <LINE>But when he once attains the upmost round.</LINE>
            <LINE>He then unto the ladder turns his back,</LINE>
            <LINE>Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees</LINE>
            <LINE>By which he did ascend. So Caesar may.</LINE>
            <LINE>Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel</LINE>
            <LINE>Will bear no colour for the thing he is,</LINE>
            <LINE>Fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented,</LINE>
            <LINE>Would run to these and these extremities:</LINE>
            <LINE>And therefore think him as a serpent's egg</LINE>
            <LINE>Which, hatch'd, would, as his kind, grow mischievous,</LINE>
            <LINE>And kill him in the shell.</LINE>

            <SPEAKER>LUCIUS</SPEAKER>
            <LINE>The taper burneth in your closet, sir.</LINE>
            <LINE>Searching the window for a flint, I found</LINE>
            <LINE>This paper, thus seal'd up; and, I am sure,</LINE>
            <LINE>It did not lie there when I went to bed.</LINE>
        </SPEECH>
        <STAGEDIR>Gives him the letter</STAGEDIR>
        <SPEECH>
            <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
            <LINE>Get you to bed again; it is not day.</LINE>
            <LINE>Is not to-morrow, boy, the ides of March?</LINE>
        </SPEECH>
        <SPEECH>
            <SPEAKER>LUCIUS</SPEAKER>
            <LINE>I know not, sir.</LINE>

            <LINE>The exhalations whizzing in the air</LINE>
            <LINE>Give so much light that I may read by them.</LINE>
            <STAGEDIR>Opens the letter and reads</STAGEDIR>
            <LINE>'Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake, and see thyself.</LINE>
            <LINE>Shall Rome, &amp;c. Speak, strike, redress!</LINE>
            <LINE>Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake!'</LINE>
            <LINE>Such instigations have been often dropp'd</LINE>
            <LINE>Where I have took them up.</LINE>
            <LINE>'Shall Rome, &amp;c.' Thus must I piece it out:</LINE>
            <LINE>Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? What, Rome?</LINE>
            <LINE>My ancestors did from the streets of Rome</LINE>
            <LINE>The Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king.</LINE>
            <LINE>'Speak, strike, redress!' Am I entreated</LINE>
            <LINE>To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise:</LINE>
            <LINE>If the redress will follow, thou receivest</LINE>
            <LINE>Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!</LINE>

            <SPEAKER>LUCIUS</SPEAKER>
            <LINE>Sir, March is wasted fourteen days.</LINE>
        </SPEECH>
        <STAGEDIR>Knocking within</STAGEDIR>
        <SPEECH>
            <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
            <LINE>'Tis good. Go to the gate; somebody knocks.</LINE>
            <STAGEDIR>Exit LUCIUS</STAGEDIR>
            <LINE>Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar,</LINE>
            <LINE>I have not slept.</LINE>
            <LINE>Between the acting of a dreadful thing</LINE>
            <LINE>And the first motion, all the interim is</LINE>
            <LINE>Like a phantasma, or a hideous dream:</LINE>
            <LINE>The Genius and the mortal instruments</LINE>
            <LINE>Are then in council; and the state of man,</LINE>
            <LINE>Like to a little kingdom, suffers then</LINE>
            <LINE>The nature of an insurrection.</LINE>
        </SPEECH>
        <STAGEDIR>Re-enter LUCIUS</STAGEDIR>
        <SPEECH>
            <SPEAKER>LUCIUS</SPEAKER>
            <LINE>Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door,</LINE>
            <LINE>Who doth desire to see you.</LINE>

            <LINE>Do you know them?</LINE>
        </SPEECH>
        <SPEECH>
            <SPEAKER>LUCIUS</SPEAKER>
            <LINE>No, sir; their hats are pluck'd about their ears,</LINE>
            <LINE>And half their faces buried in their cloaks,</LINE>
            <LINE>That by no means I may discover them</LINE>
            <LINE>By any mark of favour.</LINE>
        </SPEECH>
        <SPEECH>
            <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
            <LINE>Let 'em enter.</LINE>
            <STAGEDIR>Exit LUCIUS</STAGEDIR>
            <LINE>They are the faction. O conspiracy,</LINE>
            <LINE>Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night,</LINE>
            <LINE>When evils are most free? O, then by day</LINE>
            <LINE>Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough</LINE>
            <LINE>To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, conspiracy;</LINE>
            <LINE>Hide it in smiles and affability:</LINE>
            <LINE>For if thou path, thy native semblance on,</LINE>
            <LINE>Not Erebus itself were dim enough</LINE>
            <LINE>To hide thee from prevention.</LINE>
        </SPEECH>
        <STAGEDIR>Enter the conspirators, CASSIUS, CASCA, DECIUS
BRUTUS, CINNA, METELLUS CIMBER, and TREBONIUS</STAGEDIR>

            <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
            <LINE>I think we are too bold upon your rest:</LINE>
            <LINE>Good morrow, Brutus; do we trouble you?</LINE>

        <SPEECH>
            <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
            <LINE>I have been up this hour, awake all night.</LINE>

            <LINE>Yes, every man of them, and no man here</LINE>
            <LINE>But honours you; and every one doth wish</LINE>
            <LINE>You had but that opinion of yourself</LINE>
            <LINE>Which every noble Roman bears of you.</LINE>
            <LINE>This is Trebonius.</LINE>

            <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
            <LINE>They are all welcome.</LINE>

            <LINE>Here lies the east: doth not the day break here?</LINE>

            <LINE>No.</LINE>

            <LINE>O, pardon, sir, it doth; and yon gray lines</LINE>
            <LINE>That fret the clouds are messengers of day.</LINE>
        </SPEECH>
        <SPEECH>
            <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
            <LINE>You shall confess that you are both deceived.</LINE>
            <LINE>Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises,</LINE>
            <LINE>Which is a great way growing on the south,</LINE>
            <LINE>Weighing the youthful season of the year.</LINE>
            <LINE>Some two months hence up higher toward the north</LINE>
            <LINE>He first presents his fire; and the high east</LINE>
            <LINE>Stands, as the Capitol, directly here.</LINE>

        <SPEECH>
            <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
            <LINE>Give me your hands all over, one by one.</LINE>

        <SPEECH>
            <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
            <LINE>And let us swear our resolution.</LINE>
        </SPEECH>
        <SPEECH>
            <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
            <LINE>No, not an oath: if not the face of men,</LINE>
            <LINE>The sufferance of our souls, the time's abuse,--</LINE>
            <LINE>If these be motives weak, break off betimes,</LINE>
            <LINE>And every man hence to his idle bed;</LINE>
            <LINE>So let high-sighted tyranny range on,</LINE>
            <LINE>Till each man drop by lottery. But if these,</LINE>
            <LINE>As I am sure they do, bear fire enough</LINE>
            <LINE>To kindle cowards and to steel with valour</LINE>
            <LINE>The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,</LINE>
            <LINE>What need we any spur but our own cause,</LINE>
            <LINE>To prick us to redress? what other bond</LINE>
            <LINE>Than secret Romans, that have spoke the word,</LINE>
            <LINE>And will not palter? and what other oath</LINE>
            <LINE>Than honesty to honesty engaged,</LINE>
            <LINE>That this shall be, or we will fall for it?</LINE>
            <LINE>Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,</LINE>
            <LINE>Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls</LINE>
            <LINE>That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear</LINE>
            <LINE>Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain</LINE>
            <LINE>The even virtue of our enterprise,</LINE>
            <LINE>Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits,</LINE>
            <LINE>To think that or our cause or our performance</LINE>
            <LINE>Did need an oath; when every drop of blood</LINE>
            <LINE>That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,</LINE>
            <LINE>Is guilty of a several bastardy,</LINE>
            <LINE>If he do break the smallest particle</LINE>
            <LINE>Of any promise that hath pass'd from him.</LINE>
        </SPEECH>
        <SPEECH>
            <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
            <LINE>But what of Cicero? shall we sound him?</LINE>
            <LINE>I think he will stand very strong with us.</LINE>

            <LINE>No, by no means.</LINE>

        <SPEECH>
            <SPEAKER>METELLUS CIMBER</SPEAKER>
            <LINE>O, let us have him, for his silver hairs</LINE>
            <LINE>Will purchase us a good opinion</LINE>
            <LINE>And buy men's voices to commend our deeds:</LINE>
            <LINE>It shall be said, his judgment ruled our hands;</LINE>
            <LINE>Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,</LINE>
            <LINE>But all be buried in his gravity.</LINE>

            <LINE>O, name him not: let us not break with him;</LINE>

        </SPEECH>
        <SPEECH>
            <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>

        <SPEECH>
            <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
            <LINE>Decius, well urged: I think it is not meet,</LINE>
            <LINE>Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,</LINE>
            <LINE>Should outlive Caesar: we shall find of him</LINE>
            <LINE>A shrewd contriver; and, you know, his means,</LINE>
            <LINE>If he improve them, may well stretch so far</LINE>
            <LINE>As to annoy us all: which to prevent,</LINE>
            <LINE>Let Antony and Caesar fall together.</LINE>

        <SPEECH>
            <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
            <LINE>Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,</LINE>
            <LINE>To cut the head off and then hack the limbs,</LINE>
            <LINE>Like wrath in death and envy afterwards;</LINE>
            <LINE>For Antony is but a limb of Caesar:</LINE>
            <LINE>Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.</LINE>
            <LINE>We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar;</LINE>
            <LINE>And in the spirit of men there is no blood:</LINE>
            <LINE>O, that we then could come by Caesar's spirit,</LINE>
            <LINE>And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,</LINE>
            <LINE>Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,</LINE>
            <LINE>Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;</LINE>
            <LINE>Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,</LINE>
            <LINE>Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds:</LINE>
            <LINE>And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,</LINE>
            <LINE>Stir up their servants to an act of rage,</LINE>
            <LINE>And after seem to chide 'em. This shall make</LINE>
            <LINE>Our purpose necessary and not envious:</LINE>
            <LINE>Which so appearing to the common eyes,</LINE>
            <LINE>We shall be call'd purgers, not murderers.</LINE>
            <LINE>And for Mark Antony, think not of him;</LINE>
            <LINE>For he can do no more than Caesar's arm</LINE>
            <LINE>When Caesar's head is off.</LINE>

            <LINE>Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him:</LINE>
