            <LINE>He hath brought many captives home to Rome</LINE>

            <LINE>Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?</LINE>
            <LINE>When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:</LINE>
            <LINE>Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:</LINE>
            <LINE>Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;</LINE>
            <LINE>And Brutus is an honourable man.</LINE>
            <LINE>You all did see that on the Lupercal</LINE>
            <LINE>I thrice presented him a kingly crown,</LINE>
