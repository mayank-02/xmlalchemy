        <LINE>If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius,</LINE>
        <LINE>He should not humour me. I will this night,</LINE>

        <LINE>O mighty Caesar! dost thou lie so low?</LINE>
        <LINE>Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,</LINE>
        <LINE>Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.</LINE>
        <LINE>I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,</LINE>
        <LINE>Who else must be let blood, who else is rank:</LINE>
        <LINE>If I myself, there is no hour so fit</LINE>
        <LINE>As Caesar's death hour, nor no instrument</LINE>
        <LINE>Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich</LINE>
        <LINE>With the most noble blood of all this world.</LINE>
        <LINE>I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,</LINE>
        <LINE>Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,</LINE>
        <LINE>Fulfil your pleasure. Live a thousand years,</LINE>
        <LINE>I shall not find myself so apt to die:</LINE>
        <LINE>No place will please me so, no mean of death,</LINE>
        <LINE>As here by Caesar, and by you cut off,</LINE>

    </SPEECH>

        <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>I doubt not of your wisdom.</LINE>
        <LINE>Let each man render me his bloody hand:</LINE>
        <LINE>First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you;</LINE>
        <LINE>Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand;</LINE>
        <LINE>Now, Decius Brutus, yours: now yours, Metellus;</LINE>
        <LINE>Yours, Cinna; and, my valiant Casca, yours;</LINE>
        <LINE>Though last, not last in love, yours, good Trebonius.</LINE>
        <LINE>Gentlemen all,--alas, what shall I say?</LINE>
        <LINE>My credit now stands on such slippery ground,</LINE>
        <LINE>That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,</LINE>
        <LINE>Either a coward or a flatterer.</LINE>
        <LINE>That I did love thee, Caesar, O, 'tis true:</LINE>
        <LINE>If then thy spirit look upon us now,</LINE>
        <LINE>Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death,</LINE>
        <LINE>To see thy thy Anthony making his peace,</LINE>
        <LINE>Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,</LINE>
        <LINE>Most noble! in the presence of thy corse?</LINE>
        <LINE>Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,</LINE>
        <LINE>Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,</LINE>
        <LINE>It would become me better than to close</LINE>
        <LINE>In terms of friendship with thine enemies.</LINE>
        <LINE>Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay'd, brave hart;</LINE>
        <LINE>Here didst thou fall; and here thy hunters stand,</LINE>
        <LINE>Sign'd in thy spoil, and crimson'd in thy lethe.</LINE>
        <LINE>O world, thou wast the forest to this hart;</LINE>
        <LINE>And this, indeed, O world, the heart of thee.</LINE>
        <LINE>How like a deer, strucken by many princes,</LINE>
        <LINE>Dost thou here lie!</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Pardon me, Caius Cassius:</LINE>
        <LINE>The enemies of Caesar shall say this;</LINE>
        <LINE>Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Therefore I took your hands, but was, indeed,</LINE>

        <LINE>Friends am I with you all and love you all,</LINE>
        <LINE>Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons</LINE>
        <LINE>Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous.</LINE>

    <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>That's all I seek:</LINE>
        <LINE>And am moreover suitor that I may</LINE>
        <LINE>Produce his body to the market-place;</LINE>
        <LINE>And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,</LINE>
        <LINE>Speak in the order of his funeral.</LINE>

        <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,</LINE>

        <LINE>Thou art the ruins of the noblest man</LINE>
        <LINE>That ever lived in the tide of times.</LINE>
        <LINE>Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!</LINE>
        <LINE>Over thy wounds now do I prophesy,--</LINE>
        <LINE>Which, like dumb mouths, do ope their ruby lips,</LINE>
        <LINE>To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue--</LINE>
        <LINE>A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;</LINE>
        <LINE>Domestic fury and fierce civil strife</LINE>
        <LINE>Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;</LINE>
        <LINE>Blood and destruction shall be so in use</LINE>
        <LINE>And dreadful objects so familiar</LINE>
        <LINE>That mothers shall but smile when they behold</LINE>
        <LINE>Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war;</LINE>
        <LINE>All pity choked with custom of fell deeds:</LINE>
        <LINE>And Caesar's spirit, ranging for revenge,</LINE>
        <LINE>With Ate by his side come hot from hell,</LINE>
        <LINE>Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice</LINE>
        <LINE>Cry  'Havoc,' and let slip the dogs of war;</LINE>
        <LINE>That this foul deed shall smell above the earth</LINE>
        <LINE>With carrion men, groaning for burial.</LINE>
        <STAGEDIR>Enter a Servant</STAGEDIR>
        <LINE>You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not?</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Thy heart is big, get thee apart and weep.</LINE>
        <LINE>Passion, I see, is catching; for mine eyes,</LINE>
        <LINE>Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine,</LINE>
        <LINE>Began to water. Is thy master coming?</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Post back with speed, and tell him what hath chanced:</LINE>
        <LINE>Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome,</LINE>
        <LINE>No Rome of safety for Octavius yet;</LINE>
        <LINE>Hie hence, and tell him so. Yet, stay awhile;</LINE>
        <LINE>Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse</LINE>
        <LINE>Into the market-place: there shall I try</LINE>
        <LINE>In my oration, how the people take</LINE>
        <LINE>The cruel issue of these bloody men;</LINE>
        <LINE>According to the which, thou shalt discourse</LINE>
        <LINE>To young Octavius of the state of things.</LINE>
        <LINE>Lend me your hand.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Then none have I offended. I have done no more to</LINE>
        <LINE>Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of</LINE>
        <LINE>his death is enrolled in the Capitol; his glory not</LINE>
        <LINE>extenuated, wherein he was worthy, nor his offences</LINE>
        <LINE>enforced, for which he suffered death.</LINE>
        <STAGEDIR>Enter ANTONY and others, with CAESAR's body</STAGEDIR>
        <LINE>Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony: who,</LINE>
        <LINE>though he had no hand in his death, shall receive</LINE>
        <LINE>the benefit of his dying, a place in the</LINE>
        <LINE>commonwealth; as which of you shall not? With this</LINE>
        <LINE>I depart,--that, as I slew my best lover for the</LINE>
        <LINE>good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself,</LINE>
        <LINE>when it shall please my country to need my death.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>You gentle Romans,--</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;</LINE>
        <LINE>I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.</LINE>
        <LINE>The evil that men do lives after them;</LINE>
        <LINE>The good is oft interred with their bones;</LINE>
        <LINE>So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus</LINE>
        <LINE>Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:</LINE>
        <LINE>If it were so, it was a grievous fault,</LINE>
        <LINE>And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.</LINE>
        <LINE>Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest--</LINE>
        <LINE>For Brutus is an honourable man;</LINE>
        <LINE>So are they all, all honourable men--</LINE>
        <LINE>Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.</LINE>
        <LINE>He was my friend, faithful and just to me:</LINE>
        <LINE>But Brutus says he was ambitious;</LINE>
        <LINE>And Brutus is an honourable man.</LINE>
        <LINE>He hath brought many captives home to Rome</LINE>
        <LINE>Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:</LINE>
        <LINE>Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?</LINE>
        <LINE>When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:</LINE>
        <LINE>Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:</LINE>
        <LINE>Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;</LINE>
        <LINE>And Brutus is an honourable man.</LINE>
        <LINE>You all did see that on the Lupercal</LINE>
        <LINE>I thrice presented him a kingly crown,</LINE>
        <LINE>Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?</LINE>
        <LINE>Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;</LINE>
        <LINE>And, sure, he is an honourable man.</LINE>
        <LINE>I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,</LINE>
        <LINE>But here I am to speak what I do know.</LINE>
        <LINE>You all did love him once, not without cause:</LINE>
        <LINE>What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?</LINE>
        <LINE>O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,</LINE>
        <LINE>And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;</LINE>
        <LINE>My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,</LINE>
        <LINE>And I must pause till it come back to me.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>But yesterday the word of Caesar might</LINE>
        <LINE>Have stood against the world; now lies he there.</LINE>
        <LINE>And none so poor to do him reverence.</LINE>
        <LINE>O masters, if I were disposed to stir</LINE>
        <LINE>Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,</LINE>
        <LINE>I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,</LINE>
        <LINE>Who, you all know, are honourable men:</LINE>
        <LINE>I will not do them wrong; I rather choose</LINE>
        <LINE>To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,</LINE>
        <LINE>Than I will wrong such honourable men.</LINE>
        <LINE>But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar;</LINE>
        <LINE>I found it in his closet, 'tis his will:</LINE>
        <LINE>Let but the commons hear this testament--</LINE>
        <LINE>Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read--</LINE>
        <LINE>And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds</LINE>
        <LINE>And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,</LINE>
        <LINE>Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,</LINE>
        <LINE>And, dying, mention it within their wills,</LINE>
        <LINE>Bequeathing it as a rich legacy</LINE>
        <LINE>Unto their issue.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;</LINE>
        <LINE>It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.</LINE>
        <LINE>You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;</LINE>
        <LINE>And, being men, bearing the will of Caesar,</LINE>
        <LINE>It will inflame you, it will make you mad:</LINE>
        <LINE>'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs;</LINE>
        <LINE>For, if you should, O, what would come of it!</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Will you be patient? will you stay awhile?</LINE>
        <LINE>I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it:</LINE>
        <LINE>I fear I wrong the honourable men</LINE>
        <LINE>Whose daggers have stabb'd Caesar; I do fear it.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>You will compel me, then, to read the will?</LINE>
        <LINE>Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar,</LINE>
        <LINE>And let me show you him that made the will.</LINE>
        <LINE>Shall I descend? and will you give me leave?</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Nay, press not so upon me; stand far off.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.</LINE>
        <LINE>You all do know this mantle: I remember</LINE>
        <LINE>The first time ever Caesar put it on;</LINE>
        <LINE>'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,</LINE>
        <LINE>That day he overcame the Nervii:</LINE>
        <LINE>Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through:</LINE>
        <LINE>See what a rent the envious Casca made:</LINE>
        <LINE>Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;</LINE>
        <LINE>And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,</LINE>
        <LINE>Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,</LINE>
        <LINE>As rushing out of doors, to be resolved</LINE>
        <LINE>If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no;</LINE>
        <LINE>For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel:</LINE>
        <LINE>Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!</LINE>
        <LINE>This was the most unkindest cut of all;</LINE>
        <LINE>For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,</LINE>
        <LINE>Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,</LINE>
        <LINE>Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart;</LINE>
        <LINE>And, in his mantle muffling up his face,</LINE>
        <LINE>Even at the base of Pompey's statua,</LINE>
        <LINE>Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.</LINE>
        <LINE>O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!</LINE>
        <LINE>Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,</LINE>
        <LINE>Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.</LINE>
        <LINE>O, now you weep; and, I perceive, you feel</LINE>
        <LINE>The dint of pity: these are gracious drops.</LINE>
        <LINE>Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold</LINE>
        <LINE>Our Caesar's vesture wounded? Look you here,</LINE>
        <LINE>Here is himself, marr'd, as you see, with traitors.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Stay, countrymen.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up</LINE>
        <LINE>To such a sudden flood of mutiny.</LINE>
        <LINE>They that have done this deed are honourable:</LINE>
        <LINE>What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,</LINE>
        <LINE>That made them do it: they are wise and honourable,</LINE>
        <LINE>And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.</LINE>
        <LINE>I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts:</LINE>
        <LINE>I am no orator, as Brutus is;</LINE>
        <LINE>But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,</LINE>
        <LINE>That love my friend; and that they know full well</LINE>
        <LINE>That gave me public leave to speak of him:</LINE>
        <LINE>For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,</LINE>
        <LINE>Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,</LINE>
        <LINE>To stir men's blood: I only speak right on;</LINE>
        <LINE>I tell you that which you yourselves do know;</LINE>
        <LINE>Show you sweet Caesar's wounds, poor poor dumb mouths,</LINE>
        <LINE>And bid them speak for me: but were I Brutus,</LINE>
        <LINE>And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony</LINE>
        <LINE>Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue</LINE>
        <LINE>In every wound of Caesar that should move</LINE>
        <LINE>The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Why, friends, you go to do you know not what:</LINE>
        <LINE>Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves?</LINE>
        <LINE>Alas, you know not: I must tell you then:</LINE>
        <LINE>You have forgot the will I told you of.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal.</LINE>
        <LINE>To every Roman citizen he gives,</LINE>
        <LINE>To every several man, seventy-five drachmas.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Hear me with patience.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,</LINE>
        <LINE>His private arbours and new-planted orchards,</LINE>
        <LINE>On this side Tiber; he hath left them you,</LINE>
        <LINE>And to your heirs for ever, common pleasures,</LINE>
        <LINE>To walk abroad, and recreate yourselves.</LINE>
        <LINE>Here was a Caesar! when comes such another?</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot,</LINE>
        <LINE>Take thou what course thou wilt!</LINE>
        <STAGEDIR>Enter a Servant</STAGEDIR>
        <LINE>How now, fellow!</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Where is he?</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>And thither will I straight to visit him:</LINE>
        <LINE>He comes upon a wish. Fortune is merry,</LINE>
        <LINE>And in this mood will give us any thing.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Belike they had some notice of the people,</LINE>
        <LINE>How I had moved them. Bring me to Octavius.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>These many, then, shall die; their names are prick'd.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him.</LINE>
        <LINE>But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar's house;</LINE>
        <LINE>Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine</LINE>
        <LINE>How to cut off some charge in legacies.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>This is a slight unmeritable man,</LINE>
        <LINE>Meet to be sent on errands: is it fit,</LINE>
        <LINE>The three-fold world divided, he should stand</LINE>
        <LINE>One of the three to share it?</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Octavius, I have seen more days than you:</LINE>
        <LINE>And though we lay these honours on this man,</LINE>
        <LINE>To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads,</LINE>
        <LINE>He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,</LINE>
        <LINE>To groan and sweat under the business,</LINE>
        <LINE>Either led or driven, as we point the way;</LINE>
        <LINE>And having brought our treasure where we will,</LINE>
        <LINE>Then take we down his load, and turn him off,</LINE>
        <LINE>Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears,</LINE>
        <LINE>And graze in commons.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>So is my horse, Octavius; and for that</LINE>
        <LINE>I do appoint him store of provender:</LINE>
        <LINE>It is a creature that I teach to fight,</LINE>
        <LINE>To wind, to stop, to run directly on,</LINE>
        <LINE>His corporal motion govern'd by my spirit.</LINE>
        <LINE>And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so;</LINE>
        <LINE>He must be taught and train'd and bid go forth;</LINE>
        <LINE>A barren-spirited fellow; one that feeds</LINE>
        <LINE>On abjects, orts and imitations,</LINE>
        <LINE>Which, out of use and staled by other men,</LINE>
        <LINE>Begin his fashion: do not talk of him,</LINE>
        <LINE>But as a property. And now, Octavius,</LINE>
        <LINE>Listen great things:--Brutus and Cassius</LINE>
        <LINE>Are levying powers: we must straight make head:</LINE>
        <LINE>Therefore let our alliance be combined,</LINE>
        <LINE>Our best friends made, our means stretch'd</LINE>
        <LINE>And let us presently go sit in council,</LINE>
        <LINE>How covert matters may be best disclosed,</LINE>
        <LINE>And open perils surest answered.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>

        <LINE>Hark! he is arrived.</LINE>

        <LINE>Farewell, good Messala:</LINE>
        <LINE>Good night, Titinius. Noble, noble Cassius,</LINE>

        <LINE>Farewell, every one.</LINE>
        <STAGEDIR>Exeunt all but BRUTUS</STAGEDIR>
        <STAGEDIR>Re-enter LUCIUS, with the gown</STAGEDIR>
        <LINE>Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument?</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>It was well done; and thou shalt sleep again;</LINE>
        <LINE>I will not hold thee long: if I do live,</LINE>
        <LINE>I will be good to thee.</LINE>
        <STAGEDIR>Music, and a song</STAGEDIR>
        <LINE>This is a sleepy tune. O murderous slumber,</LINE>
        <LINE>Lay'st thou thy leaden mace upon my boy,</LINE>
        <LINE>That plays thee music? Gentle knave, good night;</LINE>
        <LINE>I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee:</LINE>
        <LINE>If thou dost nod, thou break'st thy instrument;</LINE>
        <LINE>I'll take it from thee; and, good boy, good night.</LINE>
        <LINE>Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn'd down</LINE>
        <LINE>Where I left reading? Here it is, I think.</LINE>
        <STAGEDIR>Enter the Ghost of CAESAR</STAGEDIR>
        <LINE>How ill this taper burns! Ha! who comes here?</LINE>
        <LINE>I think it is the weakness of mine eyes</LINE>
        <LINE>That shapes this monstrous apparition.</LINE>
        <LINE>It comes upon me. Art thou any thing?</LINE>
        <LINE>Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil,</LINE>
        <LINE>That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare?</LINE>
        <LINE>Speak to me what thou art.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>

        <STAGEDIR>Exit Ghost</STAGEDIR>
        <LINE>Now I have taken heart thou vanishest:</LINE>

        <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know</LINE>
        <LINE>Wherefore they do it: they could be content</LINE>
        <LINE>To visit other places; and come down</LINE>
        <LINE>With fearful bravery, thinking by this face</LINE>
        <LINE>To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage;</LINE>

        <LINE>Villains, you did not so, when your vile daggers</LINE>

        <LINE>You show'd your teeth like apes, and fawn'd like hounds,</LINE>
        <LINE>And bow'd like bondmen, kissing Caesar's feet;</LINE>
        <LINE>Whilst damned Casca, like a cur, behind</LINE>

        <LINE>And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.</LINE>
        <LINE>By your leave, gods:--this is a Roman's part</LINE>
        <LINE>Come, Cassius' sword, and find Titinius' heart.</LINE>

        <SPEAKER>LUCILIUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Only I yield to die:</LINE>
        <LINE>There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight;</LINE>
        <STAGEDIR>Offering money</STAGEDIR>
        <LINE>Kill Brutus, and be honour'd in his death.</LINE>

        <SPEAKER>First Soldier</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>I'll tell the news. Here comes the general.</LINE>
        <STAGEDIR>Enter ANTONY</STAGEDIR>
        <LINE>Brutus is ta'en, Brutus is ta'en, my lord.</LINE>

        <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Where is he?</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>This is not Brutus, friend; but, I assure you,</LINE>
        <LINE>A prize no less in worth: keep this man safe;</LINE>
        <LINE>Give him all kindness: I had rather have</LINE>
        <LINE>Such men my friends than enemies. Go on,</LINE>
        <LINE>And see whether Brutus be alive or dead;</LINE>
        <LINE>And bring us word unto Octavius' tent</LINE>
        <LINE>How every thing is chanced.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius.</LINE>
        <LINE>Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes;</LINE>
        <LINE>Our enemies have beat us to the pit:</LINE>
        <STAGEDIR>Low alarums</STAGEDIR>
        <LINE>It is more worthy to leap in ourselves,</LINE>
        <LINE>Than tarry till they push us. Good Volumnius,</LINE>
        <LINE>Thou know'st that we two went to school together:</LINE>
        <LINE>Even for that our love of old, I prithee,</LINE>
        <LINE>Hold thou my sword-hilts, whilst I run on it.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Hence! I will follow.</LINE>
        <STAGEDIR>Exeunt CLITUS, DARDANIUS, and VOLUMNIUS</STAGEDIR>
        <LINE>I prithee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord:</LINE>
        <LINE>Thou art a fellow of a good respect;</LINE>
        <LINE>Thy life hath had some smatch of honour in it:</LINE>
        <LINE>Hold then my sword, and turn away thy face,</LINE>
        <LINE>While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato?</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Farewell, good Strato.</LINE>
        <STAGEDIR>Runs on his sword</STAGEDIR>
        <LINE>Caesar, now be still:</LINE>
        <LINE>I kill'd not thee with half so good a will.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>This was the noblest Roman of them all:</LINE>
        <LINE>All the conspirators save only he</LINE>
        <LINE>Did that they did in envy of great Caesar;</LINE>
        <LINE>He only, in a general honest thought</LINE>
        <LINE>And common good to all, made one of them.</LINE>
        <LINE>His life was gentle, and the elements</LINE>
        <LINE>So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up</LINE>
        <LINE>And say to all the world 'This was a man!'</LINE>
