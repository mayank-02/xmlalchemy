        <LINE>O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,</LINE>
        <LINE>That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!</LINE>
        <LINE>Thou art the ruins of the noblest man</LINE>
        <LINE>That ever lived in the tide of times.</LINE>
        <LINE>Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!</LINE>
        <LINE>Over thy wounds now do I prophesy,--</LINE>
        <LINE>Which, like dumb mouths, do ope their ruby lips,</LINE>
        <LINE>To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue--</LINE>
        <LINE>A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;</LINE>
        <LINE>Domestic fury and fierce civil strife</LINE>
        <LINE>Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;</LINE>
        <LINE>Blood and destruction shall be so in use</LINE>
        <LINE>And dreadful objects so familiar</LINE>
        <LINE>That mothers shall but smile when they behold</LINE>
        <LINE>Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war;</LINE>
        <LINE>All pity choked with custom of fell deeds:</LINE>
        <LINE>And Caesar's spirit, ranging for revenge,</LINE>
        <LINE>With Ate by his side come hot from hell,</LINE>
        <LINE>Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice</LINE>
        <LINE>Cry  'Havoc,' and let slip the dogs of war;</LINE>
        <LINE>That this foul deed shall smell above the earth</LINE>
        <LINE>With carrion men, groaning for burial.</LINE>
        <STAGEDIR>Enter a Servant</STAGEDIR>
        <LINE>You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not?</LINE>

        <LINE>Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot,</LINE>
        <LINE>Take thou what course thou wilt!</LINE>
        <STAGEDIR>Enter a Servant</STAGEDIR>
        <LINE>How now, fellow!</LINE>
