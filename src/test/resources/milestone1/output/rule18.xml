        <LINE>Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault,</LINE>
        <LINE>Assemble all the poor men of your sort;</LINE>
        <LINE>Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears</LINE>
        <LINE>Into the channel, till the lowest stream</LINE>

        <STAGEDIR>Exeunt all the Commoners</STAGEDIR>
        <LINE>See whether their basest metal be not moved;</LINE>
        <LINE>They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.</LINE>
        <LINE>Go you down that way towards the Capitol;</LINE>
        <LINE>This way will I disrobe the images,</LINE>

        <LINE>Well, Brutus, thou art noble; yet, I see,</LINE>
        <LINE>Thy honourable metal may be wrought</LINE>
        <LINE>From that it is disposed: therefore it is meet</LINE>
        <LINE>That noble minds keep ever with their likes;</LINE>
        <LINE>For who so firm that cannot be seduced?</LINE>
        <LINE>Caesar doth bear me hard; but he loves Brutus:</LINE>
        <LINE>If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius,</LINE>
        <LINE>He should not humour me. I will this night,</LINE>
        <LINE>In several hands, in at his windows throw,</LINE>
        <LINE>As if they came from several citizens,</LINE>
        <LINE>Writings all tending to the great opinion</LINE>
        <LINE>That Rome holds of his name; wherein obscurely</LINE>
        <LINE>Caesar's ambition shall be glanced at:</LINE>
        <LINE>And after this let Caesar seat him sure;</LINE>
        <LINE>For we will shake him, or worse days endure.</LINE>

        <LINE>Come, Casca, you and I will yet ere day</LINE>

        <LINE>'Shall Rome, &amp;c.' Thus must I piece it out:</LINE>
        <LINE>Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? What, Rome?</LINE>
        <LINE>My ancestors did from the streets of Rome</LINE>
        <LINE>The Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king.</LINE>
        <LINE>'Speak, strike, redress!' Am I entreated</LINE>
        <LINE>To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise:</LINE>
        <LINE>If the redress will follow, thou receivest</LINE>

        <LINE>Like a phantasma, or a hideous dream:</LINE>
        <LINE>The Genius and the mortal instruments</LINE>
        <LINE>Are then in council; and the state of man,</LINE>
        <LINE>Like to a little kingdom, suffers then</LINE>

        <LINE>To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, conspiracy;</LINE>
        <LINE>Hide it in smiles and affability:</LINE>
        <LINE>For if thou path, thy native semblance on,</LINE>

        <LINE>To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue--</LINE>
        <LINE>A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;</LINE>
        <LINE>Domestic fury and fierce civil strife</LINE>

    </SPEECH>

        <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Then none have I offended. I have done no more to</LINE>

        <STAGEDIR>Enter ANTONY and others, with CAESAR's body</STAGEDIR>
        <LINE>Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony: who,</LINE>

        <STAGEDIR>Music, and a song</STAGEDIR>
        <LINE>This is a sleepy tune. O murderous slumber,</LINE>
        <LINE>Lay'st thou thy leaden mace upon my boy,</LINE>
        <LINE>That plays thee music? Gentle knave, good night;</LINE>
        <LINE>I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee:</LINE>

        <LINE>How ill this taper burns! Ha! who comes here?</LINE>
        <LINE>I think it is the weakness of mine eyes</LINE>
        <LINE>That shapes this monstrous apparition.</LINE>
        <LINE>It comes upon me. Art thou any thing?</LINE>
